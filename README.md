# Title

Visualisation of Sorting Algorithms

# Introduction

The web application is highly interactive and equipped with powerful tools for visualising the sorting approaches covered in COM1009 Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures at The University of Sheffield. The software is able to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms on large inputs based on number of comparisons and swaps, distance traveled and time required to execute.

# Features

- Animations: BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, RadixSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, QuickSort, R-QuickSort, CountingSort
- Customisable input, speed controller, action tracker, animation review
- Performance comparison tools with GoogleCharts
- Sortopedia for introduction to algorithms and understanding the working principles of the above mentioned sorting algorithms
