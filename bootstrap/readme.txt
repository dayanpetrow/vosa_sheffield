This directory contains:

The Bootstrap framework => downloaded from http://getbootstrap.com/
The JQuery library => downloaded from https://jquery.com/
GoogleCharts for Developers => https://developers.google.com/chart/

JavaScript was the main language used for building the functionality of the project.
JQuery was used in extreme cases where JavaScript couldn't easily provide the desired functionality - e.g. ".change()" event.
